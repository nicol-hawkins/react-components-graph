# South American Forest Land Percentages

This project was an exercise in building a simple data visualization chart using ReactJS. Each bar in the graph represents forest percentage by country, and can be transformed by changing the year from the drop down menu. The data is fetched from local JSON files, and is passed down as relevant props within React components.
